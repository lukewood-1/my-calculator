# my-calculator

This is my final project for The Odin Project's Foundations module.

It's a simple calculator, but with the quality-of-life improvements I was able to think of, which wasn't much but I worked hard on them. For example:

- The page loads with the input focused already, and no matter which button you click or if you use the keyboard, the visor stays focused so you can use the keyboard at all times(unless you focus out of the input by choice);

- Absolutely everything that could make for a bad experience or give a bad(cheap) impression in my opinion was solved. I stayed on top of the project for pretty much 8 hours in a row to get it done in the best way possible.

- All the 'extra credit' stuff was added.

I guess I can say that although simple, this is a perfecly funcional calculator, and probably the best program I have ever made so far. When I have the knowledge, I will definitely port this to Android as an app, just for the remainder.
